### Task: predict Norwegian stock price

I chose to use the Naive Bayes classification algorithm. This algorithm is a good option for the dataset and task of predictiong the NAS stock price as it can operate with data in real time to calculate very accurate results. This algorithm is based on probability and is often used for weather forecast and spam detection. It treats each feature of the data as independent, so it's not effective of combining correlated data, but great at predicting results by using simple probability. A stock price can be influenced by both previous pricing and external factors, so the accuracy will naturally vary.
