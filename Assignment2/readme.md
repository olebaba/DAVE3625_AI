## Assignment 2

### Task: predict Norwegian stock price

I chose to use K-Nearest Neighbour as this algorithm is populary used for predictiond stock prices. I chose to use KNN with regression as this seems to be the way to predict a accurate price of a given day. I also implemented Naive Bayes algorithm to predict if the price would go up or down in a given day. A stock price can be influenced by both previous pricing and external factors, so the accuracy will naturally vary.
